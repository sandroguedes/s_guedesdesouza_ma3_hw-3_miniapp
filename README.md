#Mini App
This is a web app where the user can check out a selection of Mini Cars.

##Installation
This web app, in it's final form, uses PHP and Ajax Requests to build out relevant content to the markup, so it needs a local host environment to run. Front end should work just fine by simply cloning/downloading the repo though.

##Progress
• Front End - Completed
• Integration with Database - In progress
